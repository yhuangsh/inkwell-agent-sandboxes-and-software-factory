# TREE

Every file that matters, and why it exists. Three layers stack here:

| Layer | What it is | Where it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **app** | Inkwell, a small blog-writing app | wherever it is served |
| **factory** | the Super Simple Software Factory: deterministic Python owns the graph, coding agents are bounded phases inside it | wherever it is invoked |
| **sandbox** | six host-side phases that stand the other two up on a throwaway exe.dev VM | host only — it needs credentials a sandbox never has |

The command surface mirrors that split: `just adw` (the workflows), `just sbx` (the VMs),
`just local` (boot an orchestrator here), `just obs` (read the traces).

## Root

```
justfile              4 namespaces and nothing else: adw, sbx, local, obs.
README.md             the three layers, the layout, and how to run each one.
TREE.md               this file.
.env.sample           optional overrides only; inference credentials live in the host pi
                      agent's registry. Never commit .env (gitignored).
LICENSE               MIT.
```

## `just/` — the command surface

```
just/adws.just        the `adw` namespace: 14 ADW recipes. Carries `set working-directory`,
                      its own `config`, AND `set positional-arguments` — a module inherits
                      NOTHING, and without that last line $@ is empty and every argument is
                      silently dropped.
just/local.just       the `local` namespace: cc / pi / ipi, an orchestrator agent on THIS
                      machine. Declares `shell := ["zsh","-ic"]` because `ipi` is a zsh
                      FUNCTION, not a binary.
just/obs.just         the `obs` namespace: sessions, phases, tail, procs, kill, rosters, ui.
                      Meant to work inside a sandbox too — reading your own traces is wanted there.
just/sandbox/         the `sbx` namespace. HOST-ONLY: needs the exe.dev account, which
                      reaches no sandbox.
  mod.just            module entry: settings + the four submodules + imports mount.just.
  mount.just          create -> fill -> setup -> observe. Never teardown.
  lifecycle/          the six phases. `just sbx lifecycle <phase> <run-id>`.
    mod.just          settings + imports the six phase files.
    create.just       phase 1. Strict order: record -> VM, so a crash always leaves
                      teardown a handle.
    fill.just         phase 2. Public git clone (no auth), the `sbx/<run-id>` run branch, then
                      the host pi registry + per-sandbox config over ssh.
    setup.just        phase 3. provision.sh, then the FIVE-assertion gate.
    execute.just      phase 4. Full SDLC inside the box, detached, returns a pid.
    observe.just      phase 5. Start both servers, expose 4501 publicly, print both URLs.
    teardown.just     phase 6. Harvests first, then destroy -> close.
  manage/             auxiliary: preflight, readback, fleet ops.
    mod.just          settings + imports + the `doctor` preflight.
    list.just         every run: state, VM alive.
    harvest.just      bundle the run branch off the VM into refs/sandbox/<run-id>.
  run/                put work in, or look inside.
    mod.just          `run cmd` (inspect, synchronous) and `run agent` (resumable Claude Code
                      session inside the box).
  orch/               boot a host-side orchestrator agent.
    mod.just          `orch cc` (Claude Code) and `orch pi`.
```

## `sandbox_mount/` — what crosses the boundary

```
host/run_record.py    the ONLY state shared across the six phases (each is a separate
                      process). Without it teardown cannot know which VM to destroy or
                      which commits to harvest.
host/runs_table.py    renders `just sbx manage list`. A file, not embedded, because an unindented
                      line inside a just recipe body TERMINATES the recipe.
host/roster_keys.sh   maps each roster provider to the env var pi's built-in provider
                      reads; FILL fails fast on a missing key and `doctor` asserts it.
guest/provision.sh    runs INSIDE the VM: installs bun + just from CDNs
                      (never apt), installs/upgrades the pi agent to latest, builds the UI,
                      inits the trace db, touches the sentinel last.
```

## `adws/` — the factory

```
adws/adw_*.py         12 workflows. Each opens with a `Phases:` docstring that is its chain
                      in one line. Thin on purpose: logic lives in adw_modules/.
adws/adw_modules/     agents.py (roster + validation), agent_pi.py / agent_cc.py (harness
                      adapters), data_types.py (typed envelopes), gates.py, quality.py
                      (deterministic checks incl. the test suite), tracer.py (the trace db),
                      session.py, runner.py, permissions.py, git_helper.py.
adws/adw_sssf_config/ sssf.config.yaml (cheap roster) and sssf.frontier.config.yaml.
                      Every model is `provider/id`; the first slash splits provider from
                      model id.
adws/adw_data/        runtime: sessions/, prompt_engineering/, harness_engineering/, and
                      sssf.db. NEVER edit sessions/ — it is the run record.
```

## `apps/inkwell/` — the app

```
server.ts             Bun + bun:sqlite, zero dependencies. Port 4501.
server.test.ts        30 tests. `bun test apps/inkwell/server.test.ts` is what the factory's
                      test phase runs, by name, as code rather than an agent decision.
public/               vanilla JS front end: app.js, index.html, style.css.
```

## `.claude/skills/` — the three skills

```
sssf/                 the factory skill: SKILL.md, 9 cookbooks, 3 references, and
                      apps/visualizer/ (the observability UI: Bun server + Vue, polls
                      sssf.db, serves dist/ when built). Portable — it stamps other repos.
sssf-sandbox-orchestrator/  HOST-ONLY skill that drives the six phases. SKILL.md, 7
                      cookbooks (just_command_model is the load-bearing one), 4 references
                      (gotchas.md is every measured trap).
sandbox-exe-dev/      exe.dev VM control: SKILL.md + a vendored `exedev` CLI. Also host-only.
commands/prime.md     `/prime` — boots a net-new agent on this whole system.
```

## Docs and inputs

```
specs/sandbox-mount-system.html   THE PLAN, and the working checklist. Live checkboxes record
                      what was verified ON HARDWARE. An unchecked box means "not proven",
                      not "not written". Opens in a browser. Read the "Where this stands"
                      section first.
ai_docs/exedev_sandbox_mounting.md   every exe.dev fact, measured on live VMs. Several
                      obvious designs were killed by these measurements. Do not re-derive.
prompts/              five ready-made tasks to point the factory at (01-05), usable verbatim:
                      `just sbx lifecycle execute <id> "$(cat prompts/01-fts5-search.md)"`.
specs/*.md            plans the factory itself wrote on earlier runs.
app_docs/             write-ups the factory produced after those runs.
images/               diagrams used by the README.
```

## The five things that will bite you

1. **A just module inherits nothing** — not variables, not settings, and its cwd is its own
   directory. Every module here re-declares what it needs, and each missing line fails in a
   different silent way.
2. **`import` is not optional in just** — a missing source file is a parse error that kills the
   whole justfile. This used to break stripped sandboxes; the strip is gone, so it cannot now.
3. **`pi --list-models` exits 0 while printing "No models available."** Never trust `$?`.
4. **No rate table means `$0.0000` forever** while really spending. A 463.6k-token run logged zero
   before this was found.
5. **Never `apt` in the sandbox path** — ~148 kB/s from the `dal` region, ~35s per package. bun and
   just come from their own CDNs in about a second.
