# Recipes run through an INTERACTIVE zsh so the engineer's own profile is live.
# just's default is a bare non-interactive `sh`, which never sources ~/.zshrc —
# so any harness installed as a shell function rather than a binary on PATH
# (`ipi`) failed with "command not found", while real binaries (`pi`, `claude`)
# happened to work. Same principle as adw_modules/utils.operator_env: what runs
# here should see exactly what the engineer sees.
#
# Two things to know: `.env` still wins over the profile (dotenv-load is applied
# to the recipe's environment), and a recipe with its own `#!` shebang bypasses
# this setting entirely — `kill` below runs as a bash script and only calls real
# binaries, which is why that is fine.

# default config every run uses — override: SSSF_CONFIG=other.yaml just adw sdlc "..."  (or pass --config in args)
# Still needed at root: the observability recipes below read the same roster/db.

# Two layers, deliberately separate:
#   `mod adw`            — IN-sandbox execution. The ADWs themselves; identical
#                          whether run here or on a VM that has this repo.
#   `mod sbx`            — OUT-of-sandbox orchestration. Creates, fills, and
#                          observes the VMs the ADWs run inside. It ships to the
#                          sandbox like everything else; what a sandbox cannot do
#                          is USE it, because the exe.dev account never leaves the
#                          host.
# A module namespaces its recipes and inherits nothing from this file — see the
# header of just/adws.just for what that costs. An `import`, by contrast, shares
# its parent module's scope and working directory, which is why the phase files
# under just/sandbox/ are imports and carry no `set` lines of their own.
